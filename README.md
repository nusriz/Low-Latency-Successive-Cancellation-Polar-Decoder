# Low-Latency-Successive-Cancellation-Polar-Decoder

The reduced circuit complexity is an engaging feature of the successive cancellation decoding
algorithm which makes it to be employed in the decoding part of the Polar coding technology.
However, using this SC algorithm latency can be achieved for (n,k) polar coding is (2n-2). This
moderate performance on latency is making it unsuitable for low-latency applications. The 2-bit
reformulation at the final stage of the SC algorithm (2bSC) has facilitated and promoted the
development of low-latency architectures. Proposed algorithm has a
novel decoder architecture  to reduce the decoding latency to (0.5n -1). The decoder
has been implemented and its performance is compared with the SC algorithm architecture as
well as with other architectures based on the 2b-SC algorithm. The proposed decoder provides a
77.46% reduction in latency compared to the SC decoder and a 39.8% reduction in latency
compared to the 2b-SC Precomputation decoder, which has the least latency of all the 2b-SC
architectures.
